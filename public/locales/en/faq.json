      "id": "what-is-coaching",
      "category": "general",
      "q": "What is coaching, and how is it different from therapy or consulting?",
      "a": "Coaching is a collaborative, future-leaning conversation where you stay in charge of choices. We follow ICF ethics, ask reflective questions and co-design experiments. We do not diagnose, treat, or give directive advice like therapists, consultants or lawyers."
    },
    {
      "id": "boundaries-therapy",
      "category": "general",
      "q": "What if I might need therapy instead?",
      "a": "We notice this with you and can pause coaching to signpost qualified clinical or crisis services. Coaching is not a substitute for therapy, medical care, or emergency support."

    {
      "id": "services-which-plan",
      "category": "services",
      "q": "How do I choose a package?",
      "a": "Match your situation to the three focuses: Transition, Confidence, or Experiments. Each page explains who it serves, what we cover and what is out of scope. If it is unclear, book the intro call and we will decide together."
    },
    {
      "id": "about-background",
      "category": "about",
      "q": "What training and background do you bring?",
      "a": "We are ICF-trained coaches with experience in social innovation, migration support and organisational change. Lived experience of moving countries, rebuilding careers and holding care roles shapes how we coach."

    {
      "id": "contact-booking",
      "category": "contact",
      "q": "How does booking work?",
      "a": "Start with the 20-minute intro call. We explore your context, clarify boundaries, discuss fees transparently and you decide whether to continue. There is no pressure to commit on the call."

    {
      "id": "blog-how-to-use",
      "category": "blog",
      "q": "How should I use your articles?",
      "a": "Treat them as prompts for reflection or conversation. They are not instructions, guarantees or a replacement for professional advice. Credit us if you share publicly."
    },
    {
      "id": "resources-how-to-use",
      "category": "resources",
      "q": "How should I use your resources?",
      "a": "Use them as tools you can adapt for self-reflection or team conversations. They do not replace therapy, legal, financial or immigration advice, and outcomes remain your responsibility."
