        "id": "what-is-coaching",
        "question": "What does coaching mean here?",
        "answer": "ICF-aligned coaching is a collaborative, non-directive conversation. You bring the topic, we partner through questions, reflection and structure so you decide your own next steps."
      },
      {
        "id": "how-different-therapy",
        "question": "How is this different from therapy or counselling?",
        "answer": "Therapy and counselling diagnose and treat mental health concerns. Coaching focuses on future-oriented choices and experiments. We refer out if therapy or clinical care is what you need right now."
      },
      {
        "id": "vs-consulting",
        "question": "Do you give advice like consultants, recruiters or immigration advisers?",
        "answer": "No. We may share information or signpost resources, but we do not replace legal, immigration, financial or recruitment expertise. Coaching keeps you in authorship."
      },
      {
        "id": "who-leads",
        "question": "Who leads the conversation?",
        "answer": "You do. We check your focus at the start of each session, explore what success would feel like, and agree on next steps together."

      {
        "id": "intro-call",
        "question": "What happens in the 20-minute intro call?",
        "answer": "We ask about your context, name any boundaries or safeguarding concerns, share how we coach, and decide together whether to begin. It is not a sales pitch."
      },
      {
        "id": "languages",
        "question": "What languages can we use?",
        "answer": "English, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. You can switch mid-session. We check for any translation needs or culturally specific references."
      },
      {
        "id": "between-support",
        "question": "Do you offer support between sessions?",
        "answer": "Light touch only—brief emails or messages when useful. We do not provide on-call crisis response or extra sessions without consent."
      },
      {
        "id": "ending",
        "question": "How do we close a coaching series?",
        "answer": "We review learning and next steps, confirm any signposting, and agree on whether to pause, close or schedule a check-in later."

      {
        "id": "fees",
        "question": "How do fees work?",
        "answer": "We discuss fees during the intro call. Rates depend on package length, organisational sponsorship and currency. We aim for transparency, not pressure."
      },
      {
        "id": "cancellation",
        "question": "What is your cancellation policy?",
        "answer": "Sessions can be rescheduled with 24 hours’ notice. Late cancellations count as used unless there is an emergency or safeguarding concern."
      },
      {
        "id": "availability",
        "question": "How quickly can we start?",
        "answer": "Intro calls usually happen within two to three UK working days. Packages typically begin within two weeks, depending on time zones and our current capacity."
      },
      {
        "id": "location",
        "question": "Do you offer in-person coaching?",
        "answer": "Mostly online. In-person sessions in the UK are possible when schedules and accessibility needs align."

      {
        "id": "confidentiality",
        "question": "Is the conversation confidential?",
        "answer": "Yes, within ICF ethics. We keep your information private except when law, safeguarding or risk of harm requires disclosure."
      },
      {
        "id": "data-care",
        "question": "How do you handle data?",
        "answer": "We store only what we need to deliver coaching, use secure tools, and delete data if we do not work together unless law says otherwise."
      },
      {
        "id": "safeguarding",
        "question": "What if a safeguarding issue comes up?",
        "answer": "We pause, check immediate safety, and may signpost or contact relevant services if there is risk of harm. We keep you informed at every step."
      },
      {
        "id": "not-emergency",
        "question": "Can I contact you in an emergency?",
        "answer": "We are not an emergency or crisis service. If you are in immediate danger, contact local emergency support or trusted crisis lines first."
