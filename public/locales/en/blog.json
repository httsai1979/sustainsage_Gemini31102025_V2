      "p1": "When clients come to coaching considering a career change, they often focus on the 'gain' – a new title, more flexibility, or more meaningful work. This is the exciting part. But any change, even a positive one, involves a 'loss'.",
      "p2": "What might be lost? Familiarity. A clear identity. The comfort of expertise. Financial stability. It's often the unacknowledged grief for these 'losses' that keeps us stuck, not the fear of the new 'gain'.",
      "quote": "A coaching space allows us to name these losses without judgement, to honour what was, so we can fully step into what's next.",
      "p3": "So, the question isn't just \"What do I want to gain?\". It's also, \"What am I willing to let go of?\" and \"How can I honour the transition?\""
