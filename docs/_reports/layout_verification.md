# Layout verification – examples-first containers

Date: 2025-11-13

Verified pages (all passed container rhythm + examples-first ordering):
- / (Home)
- /about
- /services
- /services/career-return (overview)
- /services/career-return/{pricing, process, readiness, agreement, faq, cases}
- /services/immigrant-job (overview)
- /services/immigrant-job/{pricing, process, readiness, agreement, faq, cases}
- /services/graduate-start (overview)
- /services/graduate-start/{pricing, process, readiness, agreement, faq, cases}
- /faq
- /contact
- /legal/coaching-boundaries

Notes: Verified that each section uses the shared PageSection container (max-w-5xl, px-6 sm:px-8, py-12 sm:py-16) and .typography rhythm. Service sections now appear examples-first (who/scenarios/cases ahead of process/faq). Header/footer/subnav padding matches spec.
