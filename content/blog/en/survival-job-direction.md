*If you once told yourself “I’ll only do this for a few months” and suddenly years have passed, you’re not the only one.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that your current job was never meant to be “the plan”.

Maybe you took it:

- to pay rent  
- to stabilise after moving  
- to have something concrete while you figured things out

Now you know the work well. Colleagues rely on you. People assume this is “what you do”.

When someone asks, “So what’s your field?”, you hesitate.  
You might answer with your current job title, while a quieter part of you thinks:  
“This isn’t the whole story.”

There’s no dramatic crisis, but there is a gentle, persistent question:  
“How long is temporary meant to be?”

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, this is a very common pattern, especially around transitions.

Several forces are at play:

- **Stability feels safer than exploration**  
  After periods of uncertainty, any predictable income and routine can feel like relief. Letting go of that — even partly — is understandably scary.

- **Other people’s expectations solidify the role**  
  Once people know you in a certain job, it becomes part of how they introduce you, even if it never felt like “you”.

- **Fatigue reduces capacity to imagine alternatives**  
  Long shifts, commutes, or emotional labour make it harder to do reflective thinking on top.

None of this means the job is “wrong”.  
But it can mean that your life has been organised around something that once was only meant as a bridge.

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of treating your current role as **evidence that you waited too long**, you might reframe it as:

1. **A stabilising chapter that has done its job**  
   It held you through a particular season. That’s not nothing.

2. **A place you can launch from, not a prison**  
   It may be tiring, but it also gives you information: about what drains you, what energises you, and what skills you’ve developed.

3. **A context where small experiments are still possible**  
   Even within a “survival job”, there may be room for changes in hours, side projects, learning, or new conversations.

This isn’t about being ungrateful.  
It’s about recognising that you’re allowed to ask, “What next?” even when nothing is on fire.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

You might see yourself here:

- **Scenario A — Night shifts, daytime worries**  
  You work unsociable hours. During quiet moments, you imagine a different kind of work, then push the thought away because you’re too tired to do anything about it.

- **Scenario B — “At least it’s something”**  
  Friends and family are relieved that you “have a job”. You agree, but a part of you wonders how long your own interests can wait.

- **Scenario C — Skills hidden inside the job**  
  You’ve become very good at dealing with people, solving problems quickly, or learning systems — but you don’t see those skills named anywhere.

- **Scenario D — Afraid that change would collapse everything**  
  You worry that if you shift even one piece (hours, role, study), the whole fragile balance of your life will fall apart.

If so, it makes sense that your system chooses “don’t move” by default.  
Stability, even imperfect, can feel safer than the unknown.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t tell you to “just quit” and follow your passion.  
It also doesn’t insist that you stay grateful and silent.

Instead, it can help you:

- **Make space to acknowledge the reality of your current job**  
  The good, the difficult, and the parts you rarely say out loud.

- **Distinguish between short-term needs and long-term direction**  
  What must be protected now (income, housing, visas), and where you’d ideally like to be heading over time.

- **Notice what your current job has already taught you**  
  So any next step can build on that, rather than start from zero.

- **Design micro-moves**  
  Small shifts that fit into your life: one conversation, one evening class, one changed pattern in how you approach work.

- **Stay connected to a sense of direction, even in a holding pattern**  
  So that “temporary” doesn’t quietly turn into “I stopped thinking about this completely”.

The focus is on what is realistically possible for you, not for an imaginary person with unlimited time and energy.

## Part 6 — Tools & Supporting Resources

If you’d like to hold this gently alongside your current job:

> 🧩 **Self-talk Reframe（自我對話重塑卡）**  
> Work with inner comments like “this is all I’ll ever do” or “I’m stuck here forever”, and see if they’re the only story available.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/self-talk-reframe)

> 🧠 **Thought Log（思維紀錄儀）**  
> Notice when thoughts about change appear — bus rides, breaks, late nights — and what follows them.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/thought-log)

> 🔺 **Emotion Triangle（情緒三角）**  
> Track how certain shifts, colleagues, or tasks affect your emotions and body, and what meaning you attach to that.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/emotion-triangle)

> 🌱 **Values Map（自我價值地圖）**  
> Explore which values your current job supports (stability, responsibility) and which ones it ignores (creativity, learning, contribution).  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/values-map)

> 🪜 **Behavioural Experiment Ladder（行為實驗階梯）**  
> Build a ladder of small steps that fit around your existing schedule, rather than an all-or-nothing leap.
