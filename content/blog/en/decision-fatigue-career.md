*If you feel too tired to think about your career and too uneasy not to, you’re not being difficult. You’re probably exhausted.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that your relationship with “career decisions” has changed.

There was a time when you could list pros and cons, talk to a few people, and then decide.

Now, even small questions feel heavy:

- “Should I apply for this role?”  
- “Should I renew this contract?”  
- “Should I start that course?”

You open tabs, read descriptions, check salaries, maybe even start an application… then close everything and do nothing.

It’s not that you don’t care.  
It’s that every choice feels like it might reorder your entire life.

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, this is often **decision fatigue**, not laziness or lack of ambition.

Some ingredients:

- **Too many variables to hold at once**  
  Money, visas, children, health, ageing parents, housing, mental load — all connected.

- **Past decisions that felt costly**  
  If a previous move didn’t go as hoped, your system may now over-protect you against any change.

- **Constant low-level comparison**  
  Seeing other people’s stories can make every choice feel like a test of whether you’re “keeping up”.

In that context, “I don’t know” can become a kind of safety mechanism.  
Staying still feels easier than risking regret.

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of labelling yourself as someone who “just can’t decide”, you might try:

1. **Seeing your hesitation as a signal, not a flaw**  
   It’s a sign that the stakes feel high, not that you’re incapable.

2. **Separating big life questions into smaller, testable ones**  
   “Do I have to change everything?” is much heavier than “What would I like to learn this year?”

3. **Recognising the impact of tiredness on decision-making**  
   It’s very hard to think strategically when you’re already depleted.

This doesn’t mean you avoid decisions forever.  
It means you respect the weight your system is carrying.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

Maybe some of these sound familiar:

- **Scenario A — Spreadsheet paralysis**  
  You’ve made elaborate lists of options, but the more columns you add, the less you can feel what you actually want.

- **Scenario B — Saying “maybe later” to everything**  
  Courses, roles, conversations — nothing seems like a clear yes, so you postpone indefinitely.

- **Scenario C — Alternating between big plans and complete shutdown**  
  One week you design an entire new career path in your head. The next week you can’t even open your email.

- **Scenario D — Other people’s lives as a measuring stick**  
  Friends move countries, get promotions, start businesses. You feel stuck between admiration and quiet panic.

If this is where you are, it’s understandable that you feel both restless and frozen.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t decide for you, and it doesn’t promise that you’ll suddenly become someone who loves making big decisions.

It can, however, help you:

- **Slow the pace of decision-making to something your system can handle**  
  Looking at one piece at a time instead of the entire puzzle.

- **Clarify which problems you’re actually trying to solve**  
  Is it income, meaning, health, belonging, or something else?

- **Distinguish fear of regret from genuine warning signals**  
  Not every discomfort is a sign to stop. Some is simply the discomfort of growth.

- **Experiment with reversible decisions**  
  Small steps that you can adjust without burning everything behind you.

- **Rebuild trust in your own judgment**  
  By noticing times you’ve made good-enough decisions in the past, even under pressure.

The goal is not perfection, but “good enough for now, with room to adjust”.
