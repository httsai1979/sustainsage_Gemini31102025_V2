*If you’ve ever opened your CV and felt a small wave of shame instead of pride, you’re not the only one.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that every time you update your CV, you hesitate over certain lines.

A job you left early.  
A role that had nothing to do with what you’re doing now.  
A three-year gap that still feels hard to explain in one sentence.

Perhaps you find yourself scrolling other people’s LinkedIn profiles, wondering how their paths look so straight, while yours seems to zigzag across cities, industries, and life events.

No one is criticising you out loud.  
But there is a very persistent inner voice, asking:  
“Who is going to take this seriously?”

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, nothing here is a character flaw.  
It’s a very human response to uncertainty and comparison.

A lot of us grew up with the idea that a “good career” is:

- linear  
- upward  
- explainable in two neat paragraphs

So when life doesn’t follow that pattern — maybe because of migration, health, caring responsibilities, redundancy, or simply curiosity — the story quietly becomes:  
“I’ve broken the rules. My CV is now evidence of that.”

Common misunderstandings often include:

- **“Employers only want straight lines.”**  
  In reality, many employers are trying to work out how you think, not whether your path is symmetrical.

- **“My gaps are proof of failure.”**  
  A gap is often a placeholder for something complex: illness, parenting, grief, burnout, relocation. The CV format simply doesn’t know how to hold that story.

- **“I’m behind everyone my age.”**  
  This is comparison, not data. You’re comparing your full, messy background against someone else’s edited highlights.

You feel stuck not because there’s something wrong with you, but because you’ve been looking at your life through a very narrow template.

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of seeing your CV as a “report card on being an adult”, you might experiment with a different framing:

1. **Your CV as a map, not a verdict**  
   It doesn’t have to prove that every step was perfect. It just needs to make it clearer where you’ve been and what you learned along the way.

2. **Your detours as evidence of adaptability**  
   Moving countries, changing sectors, taking time out — these are all forms of responding to reality. They can be framed as flexibility rather than failure.

3. **Your next chapter as the main focus**  
   The point of your CV is not to justify your past to a stranger. It’s to make it easier for someone to imagine working with you now.

This isn’t about pretending everything was fine.  
It’s about recognising that “messy” and “valuable” can exist in the same story.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

Here are a few scenarios where this might feel familiar:

- **Scenario A — Mid-career, many chapters**  
  You’re in your forties, with experiences in hospitality, admin, and a period of self-employment. You’d like to move into a more stable role, but telling this story in two pages feels impossible.

- **Scenario B — Newcomer in the UK**  
  In your home country you were a manager. In the UK you’ve been doing temporary work while figuring out childcare, housing, and immigration paperwork. On paper, it looks like a “downgrade”, but in reality you’ve been carrying a huge amount.

- **Scenario C — Returning after a break**  
  You stepped away from work to care for a parent or child. Now you’re ready to return, but your CV doesn’t show the skills you actually used every day — negotiation, organising, advocacy.

- **Scenario D — Trying something new “too late”**  
  You’d like to retrain or move into a different field, but a part of you keeps saying: “At my age, I should already know what I’m doing.”

If you recognise yourself in any of these, you’re not broken.  
You’re simply at a point where the old story no longer fits.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t rewrite your CV for you, and it doesn’t promise that every employer will suddenly understand your journey.

What it can offer is a quieter, structured space to:

- **Untangle your own story first**  
  Before you explain anything to others, you get to hear how *you* make sense of your path.

- **Notice the skills that don’t show up as job titles**  
  Managing a household across cultures, getting through a crisis, starting again — these are all forms of competence.

- **Distinguish “what happened” from “what it means about me”**  
  A redundancy, a migration, or a break are events, not definitions of your worth.

- **Experiment with new ways to speak about your path**  
  Without overselling, without apologising — just stating clearly what you bring.

- **Plan gentle next steps**  
  Maybe that’s updating one section of your CV, talking to one person, or applying for one role that feels slightly uncomfortable but not overwhelming.

It’s not about a dramatic makeover.  
It’s about giving you enough clarity and self-respect to take the next small step.
