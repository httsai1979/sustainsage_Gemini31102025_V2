*If you’ve ever refreshed your email again and again, just to see “no new messages” from employers, you’re not alone.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that job searching in a new country feels different from anything you’ve done before.

You adjust your CV to match local style.  
You rewrite your cover letter, again.  
You press “submit” and… then nothing happens.

Days go by.  
You start to recognise company names only because you’ve already applied there three times.

Meanwhile, life keeps moving — rent, food, children, family back home asking:  
“Any news?”

On the outside, you might say, “I’m still looking.”  
On the inside, the sentence may be closer to:  
“I’m trying very hard to stay hopeful.”

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, what you’re facing is not “just” a job search.  
It’s the intersection of several layers:

- **New systems and unspoken rules**  
  Different recruitment platforms, different expectations around CVs, cover letters, and references.

- **A different way of reading your experience**  
  Titles from your home country may not translate directly. People skim rather than understand.

- **Emotional and practical pressure combined**  
  You may need income, stability, or a visa. It’s hard to stay reflective when each silence feels expensive.

This can quietly turn into:

- “Maybe my experience wasn’t real.”  
- “Maybe I was never as good as I thought.”  
- “Maybe no one here will ever see me properly.”

You’re not overreacting.  
You’re reacting to real uncertainty, in a context where feedback is minimal and slow.

---

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of reading every silence as **“proof there’s something wrong with me”**, you might experiment with:

1. **Seeing this as a translation problem, not an identity problem**  
   Your skills and history are real. The task is to translate them into a format this system can recognise, which is frustrating — but different from being “worthless”.

2. **Separating process feedback from personal worth**  
   A lack of reply often says more about volume, systems, or bias than about your ability as a human being.

3. **Recognising the double load you’re carrying**  
   You are learning a new labour market *and* managing daily life in a new place. That is already a lot.

This doesn’t remove the difficulty.  
But it can soften the harshness of the story you tell yourself in the meantime.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

A few very ordinary, very heavy situations:

- **Scenario A — Overqualified on paper, overlooked in practice**  
  Back home, you led teams. In the UK, you’re applying for roles that are technically “below” what you’ve done before, and still rarely hear back.

- **Scenario B — Language as an extra filter**  
  You can work in English, but writing applications is still slow. You worry that small mistakes in wording will make people dismiss you.

- **Scenario C — Balancing any job vs. the “right” job**  
  You consider taking any work just to have income, while also fearing that if you do, you’ll be stuck there for years.

- **Scenario D — Family watching from a distance**  
  People back home might think you’re “living abroad” in a glamorous way, while you quietly stress over supermarket prices and application deadlines.

If your energy drops each time you open the job site, it’s not because you’re lazy.  
It’s because your nervous system has learned to associate it with uncertainty.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t change the job market, and it doesn’t guarantee responses from employers.

What it can provide is:

- **Space to name what’s actually happening**  
  So you’re not carrying everything alone in your head.

- **Clarity around your current priorities**  
  For example: is your first goal income, stability, experience in the UK, or alignment with your long-term field?

- **Support in designing a sustainable search rhythm**  
  How many applications per week is realistic *for your life*, not for an imaginary ideal candidate?

- **A way to separate self-talk from facts**  
  Noticing when “I didn’t get this role” turns into “I’m not capable of anything”.

- **Permission to hold multiple options**  
  Temporary roles, volunteering, training, or a portfolio of smaller pieces instead of a single “perfect job”.

The aim is not to make you “positive” all the time.  
It’s to keep you grounded enough to continue without erasing your feelings.
