*If a short comment from a manager can stay in your mind for weeks, you’re not being dramatic.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that on feedback days, your body reacts before your mind does.

An email invite to a one-to-one.  
A calendar reminder labelled “review”.  
A casual “Can we talk later?” from your manager.

Even when you know you’ve done solid work, a part of you quietly prepares for the worst.

After the conversation, you may remember one sentence more than anything else — especially the one that sounded even slightly negative.  
It replays later when you’re cooking, commuting, or trying to sleep.

On the outside, you nod and say, “Thanks, that’s helpful.”  
On the inside, the story might be closer to:  
“I’m not good enough. They’ve noticed.”

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, this isn’t a sign that you’re “too sensitive”.  
It’s often what happens when **feedback lands directly on older, deeper stories** about your worth.

There might be:

- **Past experiences of criticism**  
  At school, at home, in previous jobs — where “feedback” was more like judgement.

- **Cultural differences in how feedback is given**  
  Some workplaces are very direct; others are indirect. In a new country, it can be hard to read tone.

- **High personal standards**  
  If you already expect a lot from yourself, even small suggestions can feel like proof that you’ve failed.

So while feedback is meant to be about behaviour or outcomes, your nervous system might hear it as:  
“There’s something wrong with you.”

That’s a heavy thing to carry into each meeting.

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of treating every piece of feedback as **a verdict on who you are**, you might explore:

1. **Feedback as data, not identity**  
   It is information about how something landed or was perceived at a particular moment, not a full description of your character.

2. **Feedback as a conversation, not a monologue**  
   You are allowed to ask questions, clarify, and explain context — without being defensive.

3. **Feedback sensitivity as understandable, not shameful**  
   The fact that you care how your work affects others is not a weakness. It just might need some gentler internal handling.

This doesn’t mean pretending feedback never hurts.  
It means you don’t have to hand it full authority over your sense of self.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

You might recognise yourself here:

- **Scenario A — One sentence outweighs ten positives**  
  Your manager gives balanced feedback. A week later, you mostly remember the one area that “needs improvement”.

- **Scenario B — Cultural misalignment**  
  In your previous country or sector, praise was rare. You learned to pay attention mainly to criticism. Here, the style is different, but your body still reacts in the old way.

- **Scenario C — Carrying feedback home**  
  Family or friends notice you become quiet or tense after reviews, even if nothing “terrible” was said.

- **Scenario D — Avoiding opportunities to avoid feedback**  
  You sometimes hold back from trying new things or taking responsibility, because more visibility means more evaluation.

If this is you, it doesn’t mean you can’t handle work.  
It means feedback has been wired to something very close to your core.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t stop people from giving feedback, and it doesn’t train you to tolerate anything without reaction.

It can, however, help you:

- **Separate the content of feedback from the story attached to it**  
  “They said this project timeline was tight” is different from “They think I’m incompetent.”

- **Notice what gets triggered**  
  Sometimes a particular kind of comment echoes an older experience — you’re not just reacting to this moment.

- **Develop your own internal way of checking reality**  
  Instead of accepting every word as absolute, you can look for patterns and context.

- **Experiment with small responses**  
  Asking clarifying questions, summarising what you’ve heard, or requesting examples — at a pace that feels manageable.

- **Hold both care and boundaries**  
  You can care deeply about doing good work without letting every opinion decide your value.

The goal isn’t to become numb.  
It’s to be able to stay present enough to learn without collapsing internally.

If you’d like some structure around these experiences:

> 🧩 **Self-talk Reframe（自我對話重塑卡）**  
> Explore the sentences that appear right after feedback — “I’m terrible”, “They’ll get rid of me” — and test gentler, more accurate alternatives.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/self-talk-reframe)

> 🧠 **Thought Log（思維紀錄儀）**  
> After feedback, write down what was actually said and what you heard internally. Over time, you can see the gap between the two.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/thought-log)

> 🔺 **Emotion Triangle（情緒三角）**  
> Map: the event (feedback), the emotions (anxiety, shame, anger), and the story your mind creates about you.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/emotion-triangle)

> 🌱 **Values Map（自我價值地圖）**  
> Remember what kind of colleague or professional you’re trying to be, beyond any single review.  
> 👉 [前往工具頁](/tools/values-map)

> 🪜 **Behavioural Experiment Ladder（行為實驗階梯）**  
> Try small experiments: asking for feedback on one specific thing, or preparing one question before a review.
