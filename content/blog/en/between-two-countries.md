*If you’re paying bills in one country while worrying about relatives in another, it makes sense that your mind never fully rests.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that your days are split into layers.

There is the visible layer:  
work, childcare, transport, emails, local news.

Then there’s the invisible layer:  
currency exchange rates, time zone differences, messages from home, photos of nieces and nephews you haven’t met yet.

You answer questions like “How long will you stay?” with something polite and vague.

Inside, you might think:  
“I don’t actually know where my life belongs anymore.”

You’re not fully “there” and not fully “here”.  
You’re somewhere in between.

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, this isn’t indecision or a lack of gratitude.  
It’s the natural result of **trying to hold more than one home at the same time**.

Some of what may be happening:

- **Your body and paperwork are in the UK, but parts of your identity still live elsewhere**  
  Language, humour, food, memories, seasons — all connected to “home”.

- **Your sense of responsibility stretches across borders**  
  You might be supporting family financially or emotionally from a distance.

- **Your future is hard to picture**  
  Should long-term plans be built here? There? Half and half? The answer might keep changing with news, policies, or personal events.

This can lead to questions that don’t have quick answers:

- “Am I staying or just visiting for a very long time?”  
- “Am I building a life or just holding a position?”  
- “Is it OK that I don’t feel settled yet?”

Feeling stretched is not a personal weakness.  
It’s a sign that your emotional reality is more complex than a single address.

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of demanding that you “pick a side”, you might explore:

1. **Seeing yourself as someone with more than one centre of gravity**  
   It’s not failure if your attachments are spread out.

2. **Separating practical decisions from emotional belonging**  
   You may choose to stay in one place for work, education, or health, while part of your heart remains elsewhere. Both can be true.

3. **Allowing “I don’t know yet” as a valid current answer**  
   Not every question about the future needs a final decision immediately.

This doesn’t remove visa rules, housing costs, or political changes.  
But it can reduce the pressure to have a perfectly coherent story right now.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

Perhaps some of this feels familiar:

- **Scenario A — Weekly video calls as routine**  
  You know the corners of your parents’ living room through a screen better than your own neighbourhood. Their health, mood, and local news shape your days from far away.

- **Scenario B — Children growing up in another culture**  
  Your child speaks a language at school that you didn’t grow up with. You’re trying to work out which traditions to keep, adapt, or let go.

- **Scenario C — Considering “going back” every time life gets hard**  
  When work is stressful or money is tight, you picture your old life and wonder if you made a mistake — even though you also remember why you left.

- **Scenario D — Questions from both sides**  
  People in the UK ask if you’ll ever “return home”. People back home ask when you’re coming back. Both questions can feel slightly off.

If you feel pulled in more than one direction, it’s not because you’re indecisive.  
It’s because your life actually spans more than one place.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t decide your country for you, and it doesn’t push you to “commit” before you’re ready.

It can, however, support you to:

- **Name all the layers of your current reality**  
  Work, immigration status, family needs, health, language, community.

- **Clarify what’s non-negotiable for you right now**  
  Maybe that’s safety, access to healthcare, schooling, or proximity to certain relatives.

- **Explore what “home” means at this stage**  
  Not in abstract terms, but in daily life — who you’re with, how you spend time, how your body feels.

- **Design shorter decision horizons**  
  Instead of “Where will I live forever?”, looking at “What makes sense for the next 6–18 months?”

- **Reduce self-blame for feeling unsettled**  
  You can acknowledge the strain you’re under without calling it failure.

The aim is not to find a perfect solution, but to give you more groundedness in the middle of uncertainty.
