*If every new idea you have comes with a quiet echo of “not at your age”, you’re not imagining that tension.*

## Part 1 — A Quiet Observation

You might notice that thoughts about change appear at inconvenient times.

On the commute.  
When you’re helping with homework.  
Late at night, scrolling other people’s stories.

You see roles or fields that make something in you sit up a little straighter.  
And almost immediately, another voice replies:  
“Too late. You should have done this ten years ago.”

So you carry on — doing a job you know how to do, being reliable, holding things together — while quietly wondering whether you’ve already used up your chances.

No one around you may be telling you to stay where you are.  
But the idea of change feels heavy, almost impolite.

## Part 2 — What’s Really Happening

From a coaching perspective, this isn’t simply about age.  
It’s about **the stories you’ve absorbed about what a “proper life path” should look like.**

Common elements include:

- **Linear timelines**  
  Study in your twenties, build career in your thirties, stabilise in your forties, and so on. Any deviation feels risky.

- **Invisible comparisons**  
  You might be comparing yourself to colleagues, friends, or even parents — sometimes without noticing.

- **Responsibility and loyalty**  
  You may genuinely care about your current team, clients, or family stability. Change can feel like abandoning people, not just roles.

Under all this, there may be something much simpler:  
You have changed as a person, and your current work no longer matches that change.

Feeling stuck between “I shouldn’t complain” and “I can’t imagine doing this for another ten years” is very human.

## Part 3 — A More Helpful Framing

Instead of treating “too late” as a fact, you might explore it as a **reaction to uncertainty**:

1. **Your age is information, not a verdict**  
   It tells you something about your responsibilities, energy, and priorities — but not whether you’re allowed to move.

2. **Change doesn’t have to mean starting from zero**  
   Many skills travel: communication, problem-solving, working with people, making decisions under pressure.

3. **Staying also has a cost**  
   Doing nothing is not neutral. It’s a choice with its own impact on your mood, health, and relationships.

This isn’t about forcing yourself to be “brave”.  
It’s about seeing that there may be more than only two options: stay exactly as you are, or burn everything down.

## Part 4 — If This Is Your Situation

You might recognise yourself in one or more of these:

- **Scenario A — Steady job, restless mind**  
  Your job is stable and people say you’re good at it. But a quiet sense of dullness keeps returning, and you feel guilty for even noticing it.

- **Scenario B — New interests, old commitments**  
  You’ve discovered something you genuinely enjoy — a field, a topic, a kind of work — but your current life is organised around a different career.

- **Scenario C — “Golden handcuffs”**  
  The pay or benefits are difficult to leave, especially with dependants. Yet the idea of staying until retirement makes your body feel tired.

- **Scenario D — Watching younger colleagues move**  
  You see younger people switch roles or industries, and wonder when the window closed for you — or whether it actually has.

If you are here, you’re not selfish or unrealistic.  
You’re paying attention to an inner signal that has been quiet for a long time.

## Part 5 — How Coaching Helps

Coaching doesn’t require you to make a dramatic decision, and it doesn’t measure your value by how “bold” you are.

Instead, it can support you to:

- **Name what’s no longer working**  
  With honesty but without blaming yourself or others.

- **Clarify what “change” really means for you**  
  Is it a new role, new environment, different hours, more learning, or something outside paid work?

- **Explore constraints and possibilities together**  
  Money, caregiving, geography, health — all of these matter and can be considered without shame.

- **Design small, low-risk experiments**  
  Trying something for a few hours a week, taking a course, shadowing someone, or testing a different way of working.

- **Notice how your self-talk reacts**  
  Especially when you do anything that contradicts “too late”.

The focus is not on pushing you into a particular answer, but on making sure any answer is grounded in who you are now.
