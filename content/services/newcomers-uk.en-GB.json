Coaching sessions gave her a weekly space to name the grief of starting over, rehearse cross-cultural conversations with her manager, and design check-ins with family in Taiwan so the distance felt less punishing. Within three months she negotiated clearer responsibilities and chose a community project that made the city feel more livable."
