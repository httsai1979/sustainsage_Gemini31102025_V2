      "slugs": ["default"],
      "question": "How often do we meet and how long do sessions last?",
      "answer": "Most pathways meet every two to three weeks for 60–75 minutes. Graduates sometimes prefer 50-minute calls, and urgent transitions may use weekly sprints for a short period."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["default"],
      "question": "Where do sessions take place?",
      "answer": "Sessions are primarily online via Zoom so we can support people across time zones. In-person intensives in London or Cambridge happen a few times a year when they genuinely help."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["default"],
      "question": "Can I pause or end coaching?",
      "answer": "Yes. Agreements are reviewed every quarter and you can pause between sessions, shift to lighter check-ins, or wrap up once the goals are met."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["default"],
      "question": "How do I know if coaching is the right space right now?",
      "answer": "Use the Readiness checklist for a fuller look at when coaching helps and when other professionals are a better first step. Mention any concerns during the 20-minute chat so we can plan together."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["career-return", "immigrant-job"],
      "question": "Can my employer or sponsor be involved?",
      "answer": "Yes. We co-design what updates, if any, will be shared outside sessions. Sponsors only receive information you authorise."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["career-return"],
      "question": "What if I need to pause because of caring responsibilities?",
      "answer": "We build in flexible cadences from the start. You can pause or spread out sessions — momentum matters more than speed."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["graduate-start", "immigrant-job"],
      "question": "Is there homework between sessions?",
      "answer": "We agree small experiments between sessions. They are co-designed so they feel doable alongside study, work, or caregiving."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["graduate-start"],
      "question": "Do you offer preparation before performance reviews?",
      "answer": "We rehearse conversations, co-write talking points and identify evidence to bring into the room with confidence."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["immigrant-job"],
      "question": "Can we review my CV or LinkedIn profile?",
      "answer": "Yes. Coaching time can include narrative and document reviews so that every application reflects your story."
    },
    {
      "slugs": ["default"],
      "question": "How soon can we start?",
      "answer": "Intro chats are usually available within two weeks. Paid sessions start as soon as contracts and invoices are complete."
