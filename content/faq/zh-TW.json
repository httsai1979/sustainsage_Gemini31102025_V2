        {
          "question": "What is coaching and how is it different from therapy or consulting?",
          "answer": "Coaching is a collaborative, future-leaning conversation. You set the agenda, we ask reflective questions, and we co-design experiments. Therapy diagnoses or treats mental health needs, while consultants provide directive plans—those stay outside coaching."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does it mean that your work is ICF-aligned?",
          "answer": "We follow the International Coaching Federation Code of Ethics. That means informed consent, confidentiality with clear limits, data care, and regular check-ins on how our partnership is working for you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who usually benefits from coaching with you?",
          "answer": "Clients are often navigating relocation, career rebuilds, care responsibilities, or cross-cultural leadership. They want space to think, experiment, and name boundaries without being told what to do."
        },
        {
          "question": "When might coaching not be the right support?",
          "answer": "If you need crisis intervention, clinical treatment, legal or financial advice, coaching is not sufficient. We can pause, signpost other professionals, or suggest resources that better match the support you need."

        {
          "question": "How many sessions do people usually book?",
          "answer": "Individuals often start with six sessions over two to three months. Organisations may commission three or six-month programmes. You can pause or extend after each review."

        {
          "question": "What formats and languages do you offer?",

        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if mental health concerns show up?",
          "answer": "We pause, name what we are noticing, and co-create a plan. That could involve referrals to therapists, crisis services, or other professionals alongside—or instead of—coaching."

        {
          "question": "Do you work with safeguarding or legal obligations?",

          "question": "What information do sponsors receive?",
