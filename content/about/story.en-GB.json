      "Before I became a coach, I spent years in manufacturing – leading three factories and around 1,400 people across Mainland China and Taiwan.",
      "My days were full of KPIs, quality issues, night-shift problems and the thousand quiet decisions that never make it into annual reports.",
      "Looking back from the UK now, what stays with me is not the targets we hit, but the moments in between: the plant manager who closed the door and admitted he was not sleeping, the HR colleague who asked whether she had become someone she did not recognise, the engineer who wondered if moving country had actually moved him closer to the life he wanted.",
      "Those conversations rarely had a name. They were not ‘sessions’ or ‘programmes’. They were simply human beings, carrying responsibility between different worlds, trying to make choices they could live with. Coaching, for me, is a way to make that kind of space intentional – especially for leaders in China–UK organisations who are asked to stand in two systems at once.",
      "Today, as a Taiwan-born, UK-based coach who has lived the pressure of cross-border factory leadership, I work with mid-career individuals and with China–UK corporate leaders. The tools may be coaching, but the work is the same: to slow down enough for you to hear yourself clearly, before you decide what to do next."
